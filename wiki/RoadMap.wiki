=== Access Control ===

Note to implementor: Please continue to implement the stubs and tests you have. However, we need to be at 2.0 reference sooner or later, so it's okay if you start down the path of 2.0-izing the Access Control engine.

The Dynabean stuff is a J2EE-ism. Feel free to have a discussion about not doing this bit.

=== Validator ===

Note to implementor: Please continue to implement the stubs and tests you have. However, we need to be at 2.0 reference sooner or later, so it's okay if you start down the path of 2.0-izing the Validator.
