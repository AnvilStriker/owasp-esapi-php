#summary One-ESAPI for PHP Road Map

= Introduction =

The following tasks have been allocated:

= Baseline 1.6 =

The 1.6 baseline is targeting the (at the time of writing) current stable ESAPI for J2EE reference implementation. We hope to finish this baseline by OWASP USA in November 2009. Please come back often for updates.

The Dynabean stuff is a J2EE-ism. Feel free to have a discussion about not doing this bit.
