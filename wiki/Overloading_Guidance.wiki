Let us use the following convention of, rather than parameter types, intended use of the function, in terms of security check(s) and security effect(s). 
 
I.e.,
 
_checkXXX     //i.e. additional security check performed
_effectXXX     //i.e. additional security effect results
 
E.g.,
 
logHTTPRequest(HttpServletRequest request, Logger logger)
 
... is logHTTPRequest
 
but
 
logHTTPRequest(HttpServletRequest request, Logger logger, List parameterNamesToObfuscate)
 
... is logHTTPRequest_effectObfuscate
